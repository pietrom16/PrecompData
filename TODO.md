# PrecompData - TODO


- Review preconditions: substitute asserts with error return values, if possible.
- Copy data on device memory.
- Compute error on a fixed set of points.
- Making transition to multidimensional data...
    - Precompute regular grid, n dimensional functions.
	- Precompute irregular grid, one dimensional functions. [OPTIMIZE/TEST]
	- Precompute irregular grid, n dimensional functions.
- Load data from file.
- Second degree (quadratic) interpolation.
- Check input parameters of most functions (assert).
- Consider using a proper matrix library.
- Option to add noise to data.
- Dynamic resolution, i.e. add new points to the pre-calculated ones when they are in regions not currently covered.


#### Optimizations

- Check for eventual performance penalties using boost::multi_array vs std::vector vs std::array for one-dimensional data.


##### Copy data on device memory.

- Fix device related linker error: Error	LNK1104	cannot open file 'C:\libs\boost\boost_1_62_0\stage\lib\.obj'
- How to make 'context' and 'queue' member variables?
- How to share 'device_line' with the other tools? Getting 'device_line' as a parameter?
