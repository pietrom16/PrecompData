# PrecompData - TODO


- Making transition to multidimensional data...
- Precompute irregular grid, one dimensional functions. [OPTIMIZE/TEST]
- Precompute regular grid, n dimensional functions.
- Precompute irregular grid, n dimensional functions.
- Load data from file.
- Second degree (quadratic) interpolation.
- Test whether it is worth to precompute the data, in terms of performance and memory requirements.
- Add a version member variable.
- Check input parameters of most functions (assert).
- Consider using a proper matrix library.

##### Copy data on device memory.

- Fix device related linker error: Error	LNK1104	cannot open file 'C:\libs\boost\boost_1_62_0\stage\lib\.obj'
- How to make 'context' and 'queue' member variables?
- How to share 'device_line' with the other tools? Getting 'device_line' as a parameter?
